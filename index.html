                <p>We provide technical training for activists and activist training for technical folks. We do this in a fun and inviting way, making these topics accessible to a wide audience. We help organizers and engineers find each other, develop solid working relationships, and understand how we can help one another. To date, we’ve focused our efforts on the Boston area. If you’d like to help us expand, please <a href="#getinvolved">reach out!</a>
